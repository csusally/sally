    # Spring Festival

During the chinese new year holiday, i spent almost all my time with my family. Family-Time means
too precious for me to waste. Besides, i also visited some of my friends who are ever grown up with 
me togetherã€‚We worked in the different cities now so there is little chance to meet each other in our 
daily life.  

Wish everyone has a better life next year!
